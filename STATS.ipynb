    "A correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates a strong positive correlation between SAT scores and college GPA. Here's what this correlation coefficient indicates about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA:\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnitude of the correlation coefficient:\n",
    "The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, with 0 indicating no correlation, -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, and +1 indicating a perfect positive correlation. In this case, a correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates a relatively strong positive correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direction of the correlation:\n",
    "Since the correlation coefficient is positive (0.7), it suggests that as SAT scores increase, college GPA tends to increase as well. In other words, there is a tendency for students with higher SAT scores to have higher college GPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength of the correlation:\n",
    "The magnitude of 0.7 indicates a relatively strong correlation between SAT scores and college GPA. This means that the relationship between the two variables is fairly consistent and can be considered reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Based on the correlation coefficient of 0.7, we can infer that there is a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA. Higher SAT scores are generally associated with higher college GPAs, indicating that SAT performance may be a good predictor of academic success in college."

    "SOLUTION  a. To calculate the percentage of individuals with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between these two values. We can do this by finding the Z-scores corresponding to these heights and using a standard normal distribution table or a statistical software to find the probabilities associated with these Z-scores. The formula to convert a height (X) to a Z-score (Z) is: Z = (X - μ) / σ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the Z-scores for the heights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z1 = (160 - 170) / 10 = -1\n",
    "Z2 = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table, we can find the corresponding probabilities:\n",
    "P(Z < -1) = 0.1587 (probability below Z = -1)\n",
    "P(Z < 1) = 0.8413 (probability below Z = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the percentage between 160 cm and 180 cm, we subtract the lower probability from the higher probability and multiply by 100:\n",
    "Percentage = (0.8413 - 0.1587) * 100 = 68.26%\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, approximately 68.26% of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. To calculate the probability of randomly selecting 100 individuals and their average height being greater than 175 cm, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we have the population mean (μ = 170 cm), population standard deviation (σ = 10 cm), and a sample size of 100. We need to calculate the Z-score for a sample mean of 175 cm and find the corresponding probability using a standard normal distribution table or statistical software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula to calculate the Z-score for the sample mean is:\n",
    "Z = (X̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where X̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = (175 - 170) / (10 / √100) = 5 / 1 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table, we can find the probability of Z > 5, which is a very small value.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. To find the Z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm, we use the formula: Z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the height, μ is the mean (170 cm), and σ is the standard deviation (10 cm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = (185 - 170) / 10 = 15 / 10 = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the Z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm is 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. To find the approximate height corresponding to the threshold of 5% of the dataset, we can use the Z-score table or inverse normal distribution function to find the Z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.05. Then, using the formula X = Z * σ + μ, where X is the height, Z is the Z-score, σ is the standard deviation (10 cm), and μ is the mean (170 cm), we can calculate the approximate height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find the Z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.05:\n",
    "Z = -1.645 (approximately)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the formula, we can calculate the approximate height:\n",
    "X = Z * σ + μ\n",
    "X = -1.645 * 10 + 170 = -16.45 + 170 = 153.55\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the approximate height corresponding to the threshold of 5% of the dataset is 153.55 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. The coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage. In this case, CV = (σ / μ) * 100, where σ is the standard deviation (10 cm) and μ is the mean (170 cm).\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (10 / 170) * 100 ≈ 5.88%\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the coefficient of variation for the dataset is approximately 5.88%.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution. In this case, it is mentioned that the skewness is approximately zero, indicating that the dataset is normally distributed or symmetrical. A skewness value of zero suggests that the dataset's distribution is balanced, with no significant skew to the left or right."
